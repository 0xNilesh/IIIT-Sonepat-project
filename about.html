                        <p>Prior to 2010, the IIITs at Gwalior, Allahabad, Jabalpurand Kancheepuram were set up by the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD).</p><br>
                        <p>In 2010 the Indian Institutes of Information Technology Bill 2010 was introduced in Lok Sabha. The bill sought to grants the status of Institutes of National Importance (INI) upon the four IIITs. After much debate and changes, the bill was passed by the Parliament on December 1, 2014 and published as the Indian Institutes of Information Technology Act, 2014 on 8 December 2014,  coming into effect on 5 January 2015.</p><br>

The Indian Institutes of Information Technology (Amendment) Act, 2017 granted the INI status to the Kurnool institute.</p><br>
                        <p>Besides the above fully government funded IIITs, in 2010 the Union Cabinet approved a scheme for setting up twenty more IIITs, based on the public-private partnership (PPP) model, funded by the central government, state governments and industry partners in the ratio 50:35:15.

As of 2017, 14 of these IIITs were set up, the ones not being set up are the ones in Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh and in Bodhjungnagar, Tripura. In addition, in 2015 the MHRD approved an IIIT in Nagpur, Maharashtra and in Ranchi, Jharkhand. An IIIT in Bhagalpur, Bihar was approved in 2016. Finally, to close the list of 20, an IIIT in Surat, Gujarat was approved and set up in 2017. As of September 2017, these four institutes were already established, leaving only the institutes in Kakinada and Bodhjungnagar which are yet to be established.</p><br>
                        <p>On 9th August 2017, The Indian Institutes of Information Technology (Public-Private Partnership) Act, 2017 has been notified in the Gazette of India.
